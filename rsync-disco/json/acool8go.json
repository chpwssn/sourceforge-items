At thirsty, nothing achieved, unknown, - but these to me are light as dust - ive fought through eight-thousand Li holding the field, under cloud and moon. Never take for granted time , once hair has greyed , there leaves only regret.While Revenge of the Jingkang disgrace awaits; how can my remorse be laid to rest. A long drive vehicles, through Helan hill. I swear I'd feed on the flesh of the northern tribes when hungry, and cheerfully drink their blood when thirsty. Just wait until one day I recover what used to be our territory, And toward the gate of heaven March our return\r\nAnd toward the gate of heaven March our return\r\nAnd toward the gate of heaven March our return\r\nAnd toward the gate of heaven March our return", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "acool8go", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/acool8go/", "username": "acool8go", "name": "acool8go"}], "external_homepage": "acool8go.com"}
