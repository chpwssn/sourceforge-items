The mirrors are already powered by default in the EU versions, I don't know about JDM (I think so) or US version (Acura TSX).\r\n\r\nAuto-folding from the remote doesn't come as a feature in 2009 EU Accord, although I think in does in the facelift version (2011+). I wanted to implement this is my car by keeping modifications at minimum and a simple installation. There is an eBay module which will do this, but I found that too bulky as it modified the wiring of both mirrors and needed to run a pair of cables under the dash. My system does not do that. It just tricks the system to do it.\r\n\r\nThe circuit is micro-controller based. I used a low-range PIC12 with 6 GPIOs to monitor the state of the ignition, mirrors and door, locks and \"cheat\" signal which will fold and unfold the mirrors. I own a Honda Accord 2009 warehouse manual which I used to get info from the harness, as well as a multimeter to realize how the foldin", "moved_to_url": "https://sites.google.com/site/jjss87de/home/automirrors", "shortname": "accordpowermirrors", "developers": [], "external_homepage": null}
