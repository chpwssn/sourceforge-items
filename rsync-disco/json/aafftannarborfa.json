Currently codes for three different prototype sparse FFTs are on this site:\r\n\r\n1.)  AAFFT, implemented by Mark Iwen in 2008.  This code is easy to use, and documented well, but not implemented very efficiently.  It is much slower than it should be.\r\n\r\n2.)  GFFT, implemented by Ben Segal and Mark Iwen.  This code is less easy to use, and also not terribly efficient.  But, the *algorithm* itself is significantly simpler and has \"essentially no parameters\".  The code on the site demonstrates that it's faster than a slightly improved version of AAFFT, despite the fact it was implemented somewhat inefficiently.\r\n\r\n3.)  MSFFT, implemented by David Lawlor and Bosu Choi.  This code is fastest of all, but is not terribly easy to use.  The algorithm is robust to random noise, but requires a lot of parameter tuning.  \r\n\r\nEnjoy them at your own risk :),\r\n\r\nMark Iwen\r\n\r\nP.S.  Challenge:  Improve any of these codes!", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "aafftannarborfa", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/markiwen08/", "username": "markiwen08", "name": "Mark Iwen"}], "external_homepage": "http://aafftannarborfa.sourceforge.net"}
