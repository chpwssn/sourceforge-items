This includes the components, the users, the hosts and the privileges at any level.\r\nThe focus is on IT weak configurations, executing environments (malware analysis) and people authorizations. \r\n\r\nReliability and the ability to explain the results are the main objectives. A 80 pages tutorial is provided. A powerful framework allows new simulations to be added.\r\nAccess Road simulates and explains, combining complete modeling, visual results and detailed texts.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "accessroad", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/pthaz/", "username": "pthaz", "name": "Patrick Thazard"}], "external_homepage": "http://accessroad.sourceforge.net/home.html"}
